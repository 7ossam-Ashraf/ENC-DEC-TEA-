## USAGE AND SELECTIONS


#### • This algorithm are replaced then DES in software
#### • Is short enough to write into almost any program on any c
#### • Is not a speed with 32 cycle ( 64 round)
#### • That implementations is three time fast and enhancement software implementation then DES that have 16 rounds
#### • It is expected that security can be enhanced by increasing the number of iterations
#### • The selections of algorithm (fast , safety , easy implantations , responsible (performance )


## CODE EXPLAIN


#### • Tiny encryption are used XOR and ADD to provide nonlinearity, and add and sub are used for encryption and decryption rather then XOR
#### • A dual shift causes all bits of the key and data to be mixed repeatedly
#### • The number of rounds can be 16 cycles ( 32 iterations) or 32 cycles ( 64 iterations
#### • The key is set at 128 bits as this is enough to prevent simple search techniques from finding the key [ 4 ].
#### • The constant number, delta, is derived from thegolden number ratio [ 4 ]
