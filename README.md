## USAGE AND SELECTIONS


#### • This algorithm are replaced then DES in software
#### • Is short enough to write into almost any program on any c
#### • Is not a speed with 32 cycle ( 64 round)
#### • That implementations is three time fast and enhancement software implementation then DES that have 16 rounds
#### • It is expected that security can be enhanced by increasing the number of iterations
#### • The selections of algorithm (fast , safety , easy implantations , responsible (performance )
